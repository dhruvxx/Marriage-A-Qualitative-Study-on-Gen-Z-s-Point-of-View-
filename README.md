# Marriage-A-Qualitative-Study-on-Gen-Z-s-Point-of-View-
The aim of this project is to study and understand the different expectations, experiences and perspectives of undergraduate students at a premier engineering institute on the question of roles for men and women in an arranged marriage and what factors they think influence these roles. Through this study, we will understand not only the desires of the participants but also what they think is expected of them by their parents and other family members.
This project will seek to answer the following questions :
● How do perceptions and expectations of an ideal, eligible mate vary for women and men in the context of marriage
● How do these perceptions and expectations compare to those of the previous generation, i.e. parents’ generation? Do the parents of the participants have the same expectations, or do they vary? If yes, then in what sense?
● Apart from individual perceptions and expectations, what other factors are involved in deciding upon a mate?
